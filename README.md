This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Structure of the Application

The application is structured in such a way that it separates different types of files into their respective folders for efficient organization and easy access. Here's a breakdown of what each folder contains:

## Data

> /src/data

This folder is designated for saving all data related to the application. It's a centralized place where all the data files are stored, to ensure a clean and organized workspace.

All the data that has been collected is securely stored and preserved in a file format known as JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. This format is widely used for storing and exchanging data due to its simplicity and accessibility.

## Image

> /public/img

The 'img' folder, located within the 'public' directory, is where all image files are saved. This makes it easy to locate and manage all images used within the application.

## Source Code

> src\app

The 'app' folder, located within the 'src' directory, is dedicated to storing all the source code files. This includes all the scripts and code snippets that make up the application. It serves as the heart of the application where the main functionalities are implemented.
